  <h3>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h3>
  <p>Recommendation Algorithms are a popular feature used in pretty much every software associated with social networks, like Youtube, Discord, or Facebook. These algorithms use your previous history in order to determine what you are most likely to engage with, and therefore, what will keep you using their service for longer. These algorithms are often used for advertisements as well, since companies usually get more money from you engaging with their sponsor's advertisements and products.</p>

  <h3>The Feedback Loop</h3>
  <p>Algorithms can be dangerous to people though, since they can create feedback loops. These form when you engage with content enough that the algorithm begins recommending similar content, if you continue to engage with the content, then eventually you will be recommended bias or false information in relation to the subject. This can create an echo chamber, where the opinions you gained from the biased content is reinforced by more recommendations. Echo chambers are dangerous because they limit the exposure to information that conflicts with held opinions.  </p>

  <h3>Conspiracy Theories, Algorithmic Amplification, and Platform Incentives</h3>
  <p>While some algorithms are made for individuals, the most common one to see, especially for a user with no previous experience with a service, is an algorithm that dictates what everyone sees. These are the more dangerous algorithms, because while echo chambers created by algorithms can radicalize one person for/against something, engagement based algorithms can spread misinformation or hateful content. The goal of a company making an algorithm is to maximize usage on a site, so the best way to do this is to share content that gets the most engagement, the content that usually gets the most engagement is usually what makes someone feel the most emotions. Unfortunately, for most people it is easier to be angry rather than happy, so most of the time the algorithm will boost negative content. Similarly, conspiracy theories generate a lot of attention compared to other types of content because many people are paranoid about details about the world around them, and a lot of conspiracy theories take advantage of their paranoia. When a conspiracy theory is initially engaged with, it is common for the whole thing to be ingested to get the full story. Because false or sensational content is the most engaging, and since algorithms don't necessarily care about how true something is, it will very often get propagated around so that the company hosting the service can make money.</p>

  <h3>Potential for Exploitation</h3>
  <p>Because of the way that algorithms work, they are easy to manipulate into getting attention for a creation, even if it has very little to do with the subject matter it claims. Most of the time this is used to create clickbait, which is designed to grab the attention of a user by using a striking thumbnail or a captivating title. The trend of clickbait is most commonly seen in old youtube and some of the modern social media, it would make use of the fact that content that is interacted with, regardless of length of interaction, would get promoted in the algorithm. Instead of clickbait, many modern attention-seekers will create content designed to get engagements, likes, dislikes, comments, retweets, etc. by posting something that people are divided on and have strong opinions about, since all interaction means getting favored by the algorithm. Finally, people will sometimes create fake conspiracy theories to garner attention, this works similar to clickbait, but it actually talks about what it says it does in the thumbnail and title. These fake conspiracies will also generally make no sense and will have no background research, often being disproved by a single Google search. All of these forms of exploiting the algorithm are made to garner mass amounts of attention, and they all do it by tricking the public into engaging with content that's contribution to the platform it on amounts to nothing. However, this deception of the algorithm can lead to a continued spread of misinformation, since there will always be some people who will believe in anything.</p>
