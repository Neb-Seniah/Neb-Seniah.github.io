<p style = "padding: 30px"> <font size = 5>&emsp;<b>Groupthink</b><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Groupthink is one of the most common ways that the decision making process of groups can be disrupted. Groupthink is when members of a group will agree with the ideas that come at them and minimize conflict in order to try and achieve perceived cohesion or speed to try and reach a deadline or goal. This comes at the harm of the group&#39;s goals, as blindly agreeing with ideas will cause you to make worse decisions. We can see this sort of effect illustrated in NASA&#39;s Challenger launch in 1986 or in the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, as both situations involve groupthink causing complacency, resulting in disaster. This can be avoided in the Mood and Grasp Graph by giving ourselves time to work and not putting ourselves under pressure with time constraints, as logical errors could appear. Also, we could play devil&#39;s advocate with our ideas to objectively test their merit. </p>
<p style = "padding: 30px"> <font size = 5>&emsp;<b>Anchoring Bias</b><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Anchoring Bias is when you use an irrelevant or incorrect piece of data to form new conclusions. If you see a product that costs $1,000, then you are prone to believe that a product that is 75% off ($250) is a better deal, even if the product itself is usually only $100. The same effect is displayed with negotiations on prices, if you negotiate down a $40 item to $35 then it will seem like a better deal because you got to lower the price, regardless of the item&#39;s price in other stores. Both of these examples are of Anchoring Bias, as incomplete data, the prices, is being used to create false conclusions. This won&#39;t have an effect specifically on our product, but it will affect our coding. This is because we could think that a solution will work because of false data, but it ends up being a waste of time. Anchoring Bias is hard to avoid because it is a very natural process in the thought process in our brains. The best thing that can be done to prevent it is to be aware of it and do research before coming up with solutions to problems.</p>
<p style = "padding: 30px"> <font size = 5>&emsp;<b>Planning Fallacy</b><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Planning Fallacy is a common issue when dealing with pre-planning that most people will encounter. More specifically, it is when people underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete an assignment by using the best case scenario. An example of this would be when someone thinks a project will take an hour to complete, but a storm knocks out their electricity so it takes four hours instead. A more common example would be a student taking hours for an assignment that should have only taken half an hour. Planning Fallacy can cause great impacts because it could result in you ending up massively behind schedule. However, it is easy enough to avoid, as it will usually only occur when planning your project. In our project, we will avoid this by giving ourselves a safety net and giving ourselves a longer predicted time on the shorter aspects of the project.</p>
<p style = "padding: 30px"> <font size = 5>&emsp;<b>Distance Bias</b><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Distance Bias is valuing the opinions of people who are physically closer to you than those that are further away. In a conference meeting, a boss might prefer the opinion of people in the room more than that of people who are in the meeting virtually. It might not be immediately obvious but this can have a pretty big effect in relation to the Mood and Grasp Graph, as most of the members are in different classes at different times, and don&#39;t physically meet often. This would be a problem because if two members of our group are in the same class, then they would listen to each other’s ideas more than everyone else's, which could result in the use of bad ideas due to the poor communication. This could be fixed by putting everyone in the same medium, forcing all of the members of our group to communicate in a medium where everyone is equally present, in person or online.</p>
<p style = "padding: 30px"> <font size = 5>&emsp;<b>Experience Bias</b><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Conflict within the decision making process is healthy, however it should not happen without reason, and that is what Experience Bias often does. Experience Bias is when someone&#39;s experiences makes them assume that one solution is the best solution possible. An example of this would be scientific advancements, as new solutions to problems are often denied for a long period of time as other academics believe that the older theory, the one that they have lived with, is true (examples: continental drift, sun as the center of the solar system, the earth being a globe, and genetic inheritance). This wouldn’t necessarily hurt the Mood and Grasp Graph in a unique way, as experience bias would just serve to create conflict in ideas and possibly cause individuals to make poor decisions. This problem can be solved by listening to our group mates instead of tuning them out.</p><br>
