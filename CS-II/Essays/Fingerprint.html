    <p style = "padding: 20px"> <font size = 5>&emsp;<b>Intro to HTTPS</b><br>&emsp;The internet is a dangerous place full of people willing to try and steal your information, even back years ago. So in response to this information, some of the most important unsecured HTTP sites were changed into HTTPS sites (the S means secure). HTTPS sites serve 2 main purposes, which are to stop eavesdropping from third parties, and also as a protection against fake websites impersonating other ones to steal your information (the lack of an S is a giveaway). As a response to this, schools, workplaces, and others started using an HTTPS Proxy Appliance, which allowed them to bypass the no eavesdropping part of the HTTPS protocol. Also, not to show up the Proxy Appliances, Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks started occurring, they sever the connection between the user and the website, and intercept the data as it flows.<br><br>&emsp;<b>More on MitM</b><br>&emsp;Many years ago, netscape made a system for telling which websites are trustworthy, they used the Certificate Authority (CA) system. A CA is a website that the browser already trusts, and other websites can be validated by the CA, transferring the browsers trust to the new website. Remote websites need a certificate by a CA in order to gain access to the S. This could be subverted by a website, like Sawcon.com creating a fake Certificate Authority. When you try to go to any website, it intersects that request, and uses the fake CA to sign off on it being approved, allowing them to spy on you. This method is impossible to stop, but you can detect it since you can't fake a certificate perfectly and it also gives them full access to everything you do on your browser, very cool!<br><br>&emsp;<b>Detection</b><br>&emsp;You are able to detect some of these intrusions on your privacy using sources like GRC, which allow you to compare fingerprints. GRC allows you to see if the fingerprint of a website was redirected through a third-party, or if it is authentic. However, when using these sources to check the fingerprints for authenticity, it is possible to get a false-positive. This can happen with larger websites like google or amazon that have multiple authentic fingerprints. It should also be mentioned that these websites can also return a false-negative, because there is a chance that they could be intercepted as well, and the authentic fingerprints on the page would be replaced with fraudulent ones.<br><br>&emsp;<b>Hashes</b><br>&emsp;Hashes are a way for passwords, user data, etc. to become encrypted, which means that muggles cant read them, since you need the key in order to be able to decipher them. Using your own custom encryption keys can help to make these more secure, making the cyphers return a longer string also makes brute-force attacks much harder.<br><br>&emsp;<b>Conclusions</b><br>&emsp;But the real question is should schools, companies, and other organizations like the FBI be allowed to spy on our internet use using the methods described? I dont think that they should be able to most ofthe time, as it is a serious invasion of privacy. Occasions do exist where I am fine with this abuse of privacy, namely when the website that someone is on could lead to negitive consequences for the company, or for the user. However, generally speaking, spying on your workers, even if it is just the bottom tier of your staff, should not be done as it is dissrespectful to them. Even from a busniess perspective, if news gets out about this spying and prying, you will have a PR crisis on your hands. </font> </p>
