<h3>Software Development Engineer</h3>
<p> Software Development Engineers (SDE) traditionally work 9-5 out of office jobs, and a Bachelor’s is needed to become one. SDEs manage operating systems for clients and businesses, run diagnostic tests, and perform troubleshooting. Most SDEs command a strong proficiency in multiple programming languages, technological processes, and analytical skills. I think I would make a decent SDE because most of the time I am a creative person and I am also fairly analytical. Most of the problems I would encounter would revolve around my communication skills, or lack there-of, to solve this issue we could use a communication app, like discord. </p>
<h3>QA Engineer</h3>
<p> QA Engineers oversee quality assurance and testing for products, they do this over the entire development process. Their main purpose is to identify problems in a software before launch and collaborate with others to help fix the errors that might occur. To become a QA Engineer you need a bachelor's degree in engineering. There is often a confusion that occurs when differentiating between the QA Engineer and the QA Tester, the Tester is focusing on finding bugs and assuring the product works, while the Engineer is focused on making the product perfect. I would make a good QA Engineer because I have good attention to detail, problem solving skills, and time management. Some challenges would be communicating with the developers and listening to their queries, which is a problem I could solve by focusing on what they say.
</p>
<h3>Project Manager</h3>
<p> Project Managers are goal-oriented leaders who assign tasks to the engineers and developers. While typically Project Managers lead production, they will also get involved in aspects of the software development process. To become a Project Manager you need a degree in CS, IT, or IT Project Management, and while you don't need to be an expert in CS languages, most Project Managers will understand common languages. While I might not be a natural leader, I don't struggle in the subject, furthermore, I have an understanding of most of the roles required and can perform most of their tasks, for these reasons I believe that I could make an adequate Project Manager. Aside from aforementioned challenges, I would likely have an issue with planning, which is a big part of being a Project Manager. To combat this issue, I could work together with the rest of my group to create a game-plan.
</p>
<h3>Product Manager</h3>
<p> Product Managers manage the scope of the software being made, and they are usually the ones to make tradeoffs in accordance with company ideals and values. Product Managers in Software also work on how the user controls the software, as well as how the product is marketed to the public. Once again, you need a bachelors (software development, computer science, product management, etc) in order to become a Product Manager as well as previous work experience. I probably wouldn’t make a good Product Manager despite my skill in understanding the user because of the great skills I would have to have in interpersonal communication, with both members of the staff and stakeholders, as well as needing to be able to see what is best for the company, because I am often blinded by personal beliefs rather than the greater good of the company. Of course this is an easier problem to solve, I could just join a company that has values I agree with, and it won't even come up in the ISP.
</p>
<h3>Release Engineer</h3>
<p> The job of the Release Engineer (RE) is simpler than the ones discussed prior, all the RE has to do is outline the steps needed to release, from beginning to end, and assist along the way. However, the RE is unique because they often represent a schism between small projects and large, industrial projects, as small projects don't have a need for an RE. To be an RE you need a bachelors, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to learn the other roles of your team, since you are likely to be helping them a lot. I would make a mediocre RE because of your role as assistant to the team for much of the project's duration, even if it requires communication skills. The biggest thing I would need to work on is similar to the Project manager, I can't make accurate time-tables for features so I would have to rely on the rest of my team to help me construct them.
