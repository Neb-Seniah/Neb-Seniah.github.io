<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not spend much time with the Mood and Grasp Graph this week due to issues discussed in the next category. That being said, I do still have some technical related issues to discuss that I have been holding onto. The first of which is the Ubuntu software, I don't really understand its practical application, it feels like it is just a way to get past the school’s auto-blocker and reframe the way we program a little. The second thing I wanted to put out there is that working on python and SQL for the past few weeks has started to deteriorate my abilities to function with swift, it should get better now that I finished the python module, but I have a concern that the java module will have a similar effect on me.  </p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
<p>My scheduling challenges might sound a little familiar this week, as just like on the week of the 9th of January English has taken up most of my time. This is because of the ISP and book quiz that I was given to do this week. Of course I also had other things going on, I had a Pre-Calc quiz retake, and then another Pre-Calc quiz to take on top of a physics test, and naturally the SQL quiz. I am hesitant to blame it all on school of course, because although it has been a hectic week, much of the fault can still be placed on me and some personal problems I have been dealing with.</p>
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
<p>There has not been much communication this week, which is concerning. I also have come to the realization that I might be one of the only members of the group only doing only this project, as the option was given to work on multiple projects for the year. Also as an update for the previous entry, there were no impactful responses to the issue I created, so I archived it. I don't like the idea of making gmail the primary method of communication, as it can be unreliable and inefficient at times, but it might be the only option.</p>

<center><h2>16-Jan-2023</h2></center>
<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest technical challenge I had to face over the week would be understanding the graphical interface of Swift. I’ll be honest, I still don't really comprehend it either. I set it as a goal on the project's view to review the Ping-Pong code made in CS-I, which I do hope that people are doing. The biggest part of the Ping-Pong code that I don't understand would be how different files interact with each other, as well as some of the more complex lines from near the end. However, I believe that with more time and google searches, I will be able to understand these issues better.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest scheduling challenge became clear to me over the weekend. It is that most of the people in my group have other projects to work on or not much time to dedicate to CS in general. I could tell that this is the case because most of the items for the project view (as well as comments) came in over Saturday and Sunday. This represents an issue in scheduling instead of an interpersonal issue because we don't even really work on the project on the same days, a solution could be to work on it over the weekend myself, and do everything else over the weekday.</p>
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
<p>In terms of interpersonal challenges, it is kind of dry this week. Same issue as last week and I have a solution in place, I sent an issue for people to submit what would be ideal for communication during the project. I will also be sending an email on Saturday as a reminder. Of course the scheduling challenge also does apply here, as not working on the same day restricts communication possibilities by quite a large margin.</p>

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest technical challenge from the first week on the ISP would be getting to know the new equipment. We started using the github project managing service, which we also learned about it in class on Monday and Wednesday. This software has posed and will pose multiple challenges due to mine and everyone else's relative inexperience. For example, I tried to create issues in the repository instead of the projects page, so they didn't carry over, now there are 4 issues that are closed in the repository. That being said, I believe that most of the challenges the new software creates will be caused mostly by the user misclicking or forgetting something about it.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest scheduling challenge to happen this week was with my English class, since it is the first week and nothing else really could have that large of an impact. My English class has taken some of the first days of work from me because of multiple assignments happening at the same time. To the larger point, this entire project will be littered with Scheduling challenges due to me not sharing CS-II (or any other class I am aware of) with anyone else from the group. Because of this, I believe our scheduling challenges will be based around us not working on the project at the same time, as well as multiple communication challenges, and we will have to use an external service for communication.</p>
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
<p>We faced no unexpected challenges on the interpersonal front. The main thing is that we had to get into communication with each other. To do this I plan to email them or use the directory to get a line of communication running. However, a more interesting problem is that I am the only one to have touched a README.md file, and also the only one to add any issues as of Friday 10:12AM. To end things with a look toward the future, over the course of this project our team will get to know each other, and we will all probably come out of it as better communicators.

<h3>Software Development Engineer</h3>
<p> Software Development Engineers (SDE) traditionally work 9-5 out of office jobs, and a Bachelor’s is needed to become one. SDEs manage operating systems for clients and businesses, run diagnostic tests, and perform troubleshooting. Most SDEs command a strong proficiency in multiple programming languages, technological processes, and analytical skills. I think I would make a decent SDE because most of the time I am a creative person and I am also fairly analytical. Most of the problems I would encounter would revolve around my communication skills, or lack there-of, to solve this issue we could use a communication app, like discord. </p>
<h3>QA Engineer</h3>
<p> QA Engineers oversee quality assurance and testing for products, they do this over the entire development process. Their main purpose is to identify problems in a software before launch and collaborate with others to help fix the errors that might occur. To become a QA Engineer you need a bachelor's degree in engineering. There is often a confusion that occurs when differentiating between the QA Engineer and the QA Tester, the Tester is focusing on finding bugs and assuring the product works, while the Engineer is focused on making the product perfect. I would make a good QA Engineer because I have good attention to detail, problem solving skills, and time management. Some challenges would be communicating with the developers and listening to their queries, which is a problem I could solve by focusing on what they say.
</p>
<h3>Project Manager</h3>
<p> Project Managers are goal-oriented leaders who assign tasks to the engineers and developers. While typically Project Managers lead production, they will also get involved in aspects of the software development process. To become a Project Manager you need a degree in CS, IT, or IT Project Management, and while you don't need to be an expert in CS languages, most Project Managers will understand common languages. While I might not be a natural leader, I don't struggle in the subject, furthermore, I have an understanding of most of the roles required and can perform most of their tasks, for these reasons I believe that I could make an adequate Project Manager. Aside from aforementioned challenges, I would likely have an issue with planning, which is a big part of being a Project Manager. To combat this issue, I could work together with the rest of my group to create a game-plan.
</p>
<h3>Product Manager</h3>
<p> Product Managers manage the scope of the software being made, and they are usually the ones to make tradeoffs in accordance with company ideals and values. Product Managers in Software also work on how the user controls the software, as well as how the product is marketed to the public. Once again, you need a bachelors (software development, computer science, product management, etc) in order to become a Product Manager as well as previous work experience. I probably wouldn’t make a good Product Manager despite my skill in understanding the user because of the great skills I would have to have in interpersonal communication, with both members of the staff and stakeholders, as well as needing to be able to see what is best for the company, because I am often blinded by personal beliefs rather than the greater good of the company. Of course this is an easier problem to solve, I could just join a company that has values I agree with, and it won't even come up in the ISP.
</p>
<h3>Release Engineer</h3>
<p> The job of the Release Engineer (RE) is simpler than the ones discussed prior, all the RE has to do is outline the steps needed to release, from beginning to end, and assist along the way. However, the RE is unique because they often represent a schism between small projects and large, industrial projects, as small projects don't have a need for an RE. To be an RE you need a bachelors, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to learn the other roles of your team, since you are likely to be helping them a lot. I would make a mediocre RE because of your role as assistant to the team for much of the project's duration, even if it requires communication skills. The biggest thing I would need to work on is similar to the Project manager, I can't make accurate time-tables for features so I would have to rely on the rest of my team to help me construct them.
