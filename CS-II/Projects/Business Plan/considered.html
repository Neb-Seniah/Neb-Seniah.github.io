  While an interesting idea, the TV360 has very little practical use. The problem is almost non-existent in most houses, and there are already mounts that can rotate a TV at 140 degree angles for patios. Also, this project doesn’t seem to be achievable over the course of a school year, as physical objects need to be developed alongside the code.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/avanish-jeendru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Smartshop </a> <br> &emsp;
  This product also represents a pretty niche problem, while everyone should look presentable, a filter for these products already exists. The system used to track current trends is the development team, which is pretty inefficient as they need to spend their time looking into the current trends. Often, people go shopping just for the experience and ambience, it’s one of the reasons why malls still gain traction even though sites like Amazon exist to do shopping. Finally, there is no mention of selling user information, which is unrealistic.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> The Cafe Project </a> <br> &emsp;
  In our cafeteria, at least, times aren’t a problem, the food will pretty much be ready instantly, and you are still going to have to wait in lines to pick up your food, people can still cut, and things are going to be the same (except people might wait in line for nothing if there are any problems with the service). Additionally, this system introduces a new problem, the 25 cent fee, which is not negligible when people are spending around $4 on lunch (around $45 over the course of the year). Providing the bagging of food to Culinary Arts students sounds like a good idea, but what does it have to do with the actual Culinary Arts? You are cooking the pizza, not making something from scratch, also, where will they find the time? They have class during lunch periods and have to eat as well. Also, the data collection method used is shoddy at best, with only 11 people in the school giving their thoughts. At the end of the day, school lunch lines are a strategy game, and I just eat before the lunch period begins.

  Nitpick- Misspelled studuents under problem. This has the same issue as the Cafe Project, you will still have to wait in line, and you will still have to wait for the lunch staff to have to find your order, the time it saves is just far too little, the only thing it has over The Cafe Project is that it is only a 1% extra charge, witch is about 4 cents per order.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brook-asnake/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Organizer App </a> <br> &emsp;
  Short one, it is the same thing as the reminder function that you can use on most phones, and the reminder system that you can use on calendar systems. As for the ability to do smaller tasks as well, there are organizers that already exist for that.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/caysen-mayo/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> The Unity Game </a> <br> &emsp;
  This doesn’t go into enough detail about the project (I shouldn't have to read the quick summary on the sheets to understand your project). It's a bog standard RTS game to introduce the younger generation to the RTS genre, when they could just play an old RTS game or play Victoria 3 or something (it might as well be an RTS).
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/connor-church/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> DX3 </a> <br> &emsp;
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5d02U5YYfk" style="text-decoration:none">This should about cover it.</a> DX3 detects when your eyes are closed and keeps you awake, while I imagine this would be a boon for Europa Universalis IV players, it lacks practical use. If I am falling asleep while trying to do something, then I have other problems than just staying awake, also it seems dangerous to give someone a sudden shock when they are driving.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/james-dungan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> On Track </a> <br> &emsp;
  On Track is an app that helps you plan trips to National Parks. The app allows you to set paths and navigates you into the quickest path that is the most fun as well. This immediately poses two problems, how far is the app willing to go for fun, will it rank the attractions in the National Park and send you to the most fun of them? Also, part of the fun of national parks is exploring it for yourself and seeing everything by yourself. If you are setting a strict path to follow then you are probably going somewhere in a hurry, in which case you probably wouldn’t want to go on detours without really knowing.

  Click Battle is an interesting idea, but not much more than that. You click on a screen along with other people. Although the biggest issue is that there is no revenue stream.

  Very little description. It's a momentum based fighter, with a unique combat system, but with no description on what that is. Its biggest mistake was trying to challenge MGR:R.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-bowerman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Extracurricular Student Interaction App </a> <br> &emsp;
  Most niche extracurricular activities already have a community that you can interact with on discord or other, similar, services. It doesn’t have enough to differentiate itself from similar services. It tries to solve a problem that doesn’t really exist. Also, most clubs can communicate in person when they meet, or in group chats if they have to (additionally, they go to the same school they are probably going to see each other).

  Firstly, I have talked to the creator of the project and it is not being made by itself. The application itself is a good idea, I like it. If the app existed I would use it on a semi-regular basis. In the end though, it just wouldn’t be that interesting to make.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/hamza-ebeida/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Attendance App </a> <br> &emsp;
  The Attendance App is a quicker way to take attendance in classes. But of course, there is a problem with it, you could just scan your ID and walk away from the class to have a free day. Mr. Ben wouldn’t see you leave if you never entered but it would register as you being there, you could even have a friend scan you in. It also doesn’t need to be a new application, as you could just hook up one of the library ID readers to take attendance.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jake-podewils/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Online Casino </a> <br> &emsp;
  It's a gambling game where you can answer questions to get money. It is hard to analyze it properly without more details (problem difficulty and win odds come to mind). The idea seems a little unethical to say the least. Also they say they are a purely online casino, but sell food and drinks.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/muqadam-sabir/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Spaceward </a> <br> &emsp;
  Spaceward is a Skyward clone, that is what it is advertised as. It is meant to be a fix for the awful UI that Skyward employs normally. The reason why this is a bad idea is that it doesn’t do anything new, it is just the UI change. Instead of making a new Skyward, just update the old one. Also you have to get school districts to change the system that they use, which would mean that they would have to go through the effort of copying over all of the student information.

</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mustafa-shihab/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> MyJob </a> <br> &emsp;
  It's another Job-Searching service. The twist this time is that it is for Summer Jobs, instead of entry-level jobs, the main issue I take is that there are already multiple reliable summer job searching engines out there that can be used, like <a href="summerjobs.com" style = "text-decoration:none"> Summer Jobs </a>. Another issue is how it isn’t marketed around being for summer jobs, just for general jobs, which would be very misleading.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/rupak-bhattacharya/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Physics Studying App </a> <br> &emsp; This app is far too niche, it works in a similar way to the Merlin Mavens Mentoring program, connecting people who need help with tutors that can help. Why limit yourself to physics though? You can make an app that does the same thing, but for other classes, English, Math, Science, History, and some of the harder electives could all be involved. The app itself is more of an act of charity, as none of the methods of making revenue listed is really feasible, additional preparation material could be copied, and paywalling districts in such a way where students who live in poorer areas couldn’t get help is unethical.
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jacob-fesseha/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Goose Simulator </a> <br> &emsp;
  Nitpick- The Layout paragraph misspells Ludicrous. I usually don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from another IP, but ‘Goose Simulator: Your Not So(s shouldn’t be capitalized) Ordinary Goooose Game’ feels like it takes the tone of Goose Simulator entirely from the way it was described. I also don't think that adding shooter gameplay to it won’t make it any better. The Revenue Stream is poor, Roblox is purposely designed to scam people who want to make a game, with most games being a gambling game on if they will gain any traction, regardless of quality. (a strong maybe)
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophia-tran/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> Available Tables </a> <br> &emsp;
  The problem described is a small one, and is more of a problem for people who really care about what strangers think about them. The app tells you if there is a table open in a restaurant so you can make a reservation. The major issue with this service is that it already exists. <a href="opentable.com" style = "text-decoration:none"> Open Table. </a>
</p> <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mason-graham/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> unIQue </a> <br> &emsp;
  A game that is meant to raise IQ and Critical Thinking skills. It is free to use with ads and donations being the main source of revenue, which would serve to be a fine model. The reason why I chose this would be because it is something with a positive influence on society that would be entertaining to make, and I have experience making quiz-like games from last year.
