    <p> <b> Concept: </b> The concept of my ISP game is pretty simple. You are given a short amount of time to answer 18 questions. you must answer every question correctly, if you get a question wrong then you must start over! Each question will have 2 answers to choose from, however only one of them will be correct. The set of questions consist of math, english, spanish, French, definitions, impossible quiz, and chemistry. If you are able to answer all 18 correctly, then you win, at the end you can see how long you took answering the questions! </p>
    <p> <b> Motivation: </b> The motivation of my ISP came from Tom Scott who made &#x22;You Cant Do Simple Maths Under Pressure&#x22;. The game is pretty simple, it asks you math questions and you answer them in a certain time period  but every question you answer the time period gets shorter. </p>
    <p> <b> Conclusions:</b> Overall, not much in my ISP went unexpected, my partner didn't do much work, and the other joined my group pretty late, the only dissapointing thing that happened was that I was unable to make it a graphical game, it was just text-based.</p>
    <p> <b> Revised Conclusion:</b> My ISP didn't go great in hindsight, I feel lke I could have done more than I did, I put too much of the blame on Ganon when I also had some of the fault. It was partly due to me that the project wasn't able to a graphical formatting, and it is my fault that there was an small error at the end of the presentation.
